Important parts/equations of Matlab code: 

Given the ATI data (My,Fx,Fz) the value of the moment at the hinge of the motor can be calculated as: 

arm= 0.05296;
Madjusted= My-(Fx.*arm);

Given the read current the value of the predicted torque from the motor can be found as: 

test=(current)*P(1)-P(2)*sign(velocity);

The choice of P(1) and P(2) can be either the one provided by the company or the one characterized 
by us. They are both close in the company data and our model. More details about this can be found 
in the motor characterization folder. 

Based on the direction mode the motor is running at (counterclock-wise/ clockwise) the sign of current might be 
reported differently from the motor. If the y axis of the motor is 180 degrees with respect to that of 
ATI -P(1) and/or -P(2) should be used. To retain consistency align the y axis so that the data is always following 
the same equation.
